Welcome to AgileRL's documentation!
===================================

**AgileRL** is a Deep Reinforcement Learning library focused on improving development by introducing RLOps - MLOps for reinforcement learning.

This library is initially focused on reducing the time taken for training models and hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) by pioneering evolutionary HPO techniques for reinforcement learning.
Evolutionary HPO has been shown to drastically reduce overall training times by automatically converging on optimal hyperparameters, without requiring numerous training runs.
We are constantly adding more algorithms, with a view to add hierarchical and multi-agent algorithms soon.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`install` the project.
