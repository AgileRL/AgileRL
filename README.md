<p align="center"><b>Reinforcement learning streamlined.</b> Easier and faster reinforcement learning with RLOps.</p>

This is a Deep Reinforcement Learning library focused on improving development by introducing RLOps - MLOps for reinforcement learning.
  
This library is initially focused on reducing the time taken for training models and hyperparameter optimisation (HPO) by pioneering evolutionary HPO techniques for RL.<br>
Evolutionary HPO has been shown to drastically reduce overall training times by automatically converging on optimal hyperparameters, without requiring numerous training runs.<br>
We are constantly adding more algorithms, with a view to add hierarchical and multi-agent algorithms soon.
